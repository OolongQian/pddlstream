I would like to implement a cook task setting.

First, I would like to realize a classic pddl planning domain.

I find, in examples.advanced folder is there a python file that invokes fastDownward from within.

I have little experience in programming PDDL, thus I do this step-by-step.

I copy a gripper example from FastDownward experiment example, whose correctness is ensured.

I implement a classic pddl domain & problem in /callFastDownward folder, and use launch.sh to invoke FastDownward
    in shell. The correctness is ensured.

Then, I copy the correct .pddl implementation into classic_domain/run.py.

I suddenly start to question whether focused_algorithm support Forall and Exist.

I am pretty sure that the focused algorithm cannot support Universal and Existential quantifiers.
